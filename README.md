# Calculator App Template

This repository contains a template for a simple calculator application built with **Rust** and **Slint**, used as part of Rust Workshop.

## Purpose
This template is designed for workshop participants to learn the basics of desktop application development with Rust for backend logic and Slint for the UI.

## Requirements
- **Rust**: [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- **Cargo**: Included with Rust installation
- **Slint**: Installable via `cargo add slint`

## Project Structure
- `src/main.rs`: Calculator backend logic (implemented in Rust).
- `ui/start_window.slint`: User interface (created with Slint).

## Features
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## How to Run the Application
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cristianaprecup/Rust-Workshop-Desktop-Application.git
   cd Rust-Workshop-Desktop-Application
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cargo install slint-viewer
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

## Learning Through Practice
This template serves as a starting point to:
- Build simple UIs with Slint
- Implement application logic in Rust
